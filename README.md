Overview
This repository contains a Tableau dashboard project I created using sample Human Resource data from Kaggle. The primary objective of this project was to analyze various aspects of the workforce, such as gender distribution, job satisfaction, income variations, and age demographics, to gain insights into potential disparities and trends within the organization.

Project Details
Data Source: Kaggle - Sample Human Resource Data
Tool Used: Tableau
Objective: Create a dynamic dashboard that visualizes key HR metrics to help understand and identify disparities within the organization.
Key Focus Areas:
Gender distribution across departments
Job satisfaction by age group
Geographical distribution of employees
Income variations by education level
Analysis of age demographics
Data Preparation
Data Joining: I combined two separate datasets from Kaggle to enrich the analysis. The files were joined based on a common key to create a comprehensive dataset that includes demographic information, job details, and other relevant HR metrics.
Data Cleaning: The datasets were cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and consistency in the analysis. This involved handling missing values, standardizing categorical variables, and deriving new metrics where necessary.
Dashboard Features
Gender Distribution: Visualizes the gender split across different departments, helping to identify any potential gender disparities within the organization.
Job Satisfaction Analysis: Displays job satisfaction levels segmented by age groups, offering insights into how satisfaction varies across different stages of employees' careers.
Geographical Distribution: Maps out the geographical distribution of employees, highlighting regional concentrations and potential gaps in staffing.
Income and Education: Analyzes how income levels vary based on education, providing a view into the impact of educational qualifications on salary.
Age Demographics: Breaks down the age distribution of employees, allowing for analysis of workforce aging and potential succession planning needs.
How to Use
Access the Dashboard: Open the Tableau dashboard from this repository or download the Tableau file to your local machine.
Interact with Visualizations: Use the interactive features of the dashboard to filter and drill down into specific areas of interest, such as departments, age groups, or geographical locations.
Analyze Insights: Leverage the visual insights to make data-driven decisions related to HR policies, diversity initiatives, and organizational planning.
Future Enhancements
Advanced Metrics: Incorporate additional metrics such as turnover rates, promotion rates, and training effectiveness to deepen the analysis.
Predictive Analytics: Explore predictive modeling techniques to forecast trends in job satisfaction, turnover, and other key HR indicators.
Employee Feedback Integration: Integrate qualitative employee feedback data to complement the quantitative analysis and provide a more holistic view of employee experiences.
Conclusion
This Tableau dashboard provides a powerful tool for HR professionals and organizational leaders to understand and address workforce disparities. By visualizing key metrics, the dashboard helps in identifying areas of concern and supports strategic decision-making.
